# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

Advantages of Using React Query

React Query offers several significant benefits over traditional useEffect for data fetching, particularly in complex applications. Here are some key advantages:

Automatic Caching
Reduces Unnecessary Network Requests: React Query automatically caches fetched data, minimizing redundant network calls and enhancing performance.

Improves Performance: By caching data, React Query reduces the load on your backend and speeds up subsequent data loads 1.
Pagination and Infinite Loading

Built-In Support: Implement pagination and infinite loading easily with React Query's built-in features, streamlining the development of complex UI requirements.

Optimistic Updates

Seamless UI Updates: React Query supports optimistic updates, allowing you to update the UI immediately based on the assumption that a mutation will succeed, leading to a smoother user experience.

Real-Time Updates

Stay Up-to-Date: React Query integrates well with real-time data sources, ensuring your UI remains current with the latest changes without manual polling.

Simplified State Management

Streamlined State Handling: React Query automatically manages isLoading and isError states, simplifying data fetching logic and reducing boilerplate code.

Background Data Synchronization

Automatic Data Refetching: React Query can automatically refetch data based on various triggers, such as stale time or window focus, ensuring your UI always displays the most recent data.

Mutation Management

Simplified Mutations: Handle mutations (POST, PUT, DELETE requests) efficiently with React Query, including built-in support for optimistic updates and error handling
